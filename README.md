# WebAssembly Tutorials

Welcome to my WebAssembly self-teaching repository! This project is a collection of small tutorials and experiments I created to learn and document my progress with WebAssembly.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Track my learning journey with WebAssembly.
- Document key concepts, examples, and challenges.
- Serve as a reference for future projects.
